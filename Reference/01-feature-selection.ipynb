    "# What is Feature Selection?\n",
    "Statistical and machine-learning models use sets of input variables (\"features\") to predict output variables of interest. Feature selection can be part of the model design process: selecting from a large set of potential features a highly informative subset simplifies the model and reduces dimensionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to build a model that predicts the ripening of hothouse tomatoes, Farmer MacDonald daily records the date, noontime temperature, daylight hours, degree of cloudiness, rationed water and fertilizer, soil humidity, electric-light hours, etc. These measurements constitute a list of potential features. After a growth cycle or two, her analysis reveals some correlations between these features and crop yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "* fertilizer seems a strong predictor of fruit size\n",
    "* cloudiness and daylight hours seem poor predictors of growth \n",
    "* water rations and soil humidity seem a highly correlated pair of strong predictors of crop rot   \n",
    "\n",
    "Farmer MacDonald suspects that her hothouse's use of electric light reduces dependency on seasons and sunlight. She can simplify her model by discarding date, daylight hours, and cloudiness. She can record just water ration or just soil humidity rather than both.\n",
    "\n",
    "For systems with large numbers of potential input information&mdash;for example, weather forecasting or image recognition&mdash;model complexity and required compute resources can be daunting. Feature selection can help make such models tractable. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, optimal feature selection can itself be a hard problem. This example introduces a powerful method of optimizing feature selection based on a complex probability calculation. This calculation is submitted for solution to a quantum computer. "
